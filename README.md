Continuation of a game [Craig Williams](https://github.com/CraigRWilliams) and I began as a part of a larger group in an AI for computer games class at UF. We decided to continue our work on the game as our senior project under the guidance of our professor. The game is developed in C# using the Unity game engine.

Maro Fortuna is a strategy adventure game styled like a choose-your-own-adventure novel. The player acts as the captain of his animal crew, navigating the waters of a new planet to find islands and selecting which of his crew members to send on missions in order to gather resources to found a new settlement. Once a number of days have passed if the player has gathered enough resources from successfully completing missions the game ends with a civilization reflecting one of the four mission types being founded (Science, Military, Espionage, Diplomacy).
